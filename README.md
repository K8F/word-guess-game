# Christmastime Hangman

## About the Assignment
For this assignment, we were asked to create a word guess game (i.e. hangman) using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

To copmlete the project, I used a series of for loops that first obsucred a randomly selected word (``math.random``) and then allowed the player to fill in guesses as they went along. 

Other significant functions included:
* ``getElementbyID``
* ``onKeyUp``
* if statements
* and, of course, ``console.log`` for debugging. 

## Known Issues
Unfortunately, I was unable to fully complete the assignment on time. The main issue I had was with increments and decrements; there was also an issue getting the dashes to work correctly, so when a key returns ``true``, the dashes disappear and make the guessing process much more difficult.

I plan to work with a tutor early this week to look over some of the bugs. Hopefully I can work through the problems and update the ReadMe in the next couple of days.
